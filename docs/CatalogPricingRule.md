## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **String** | User-defined name for the pricing rule. For example, \&quot;Buy one get one free\&quot; or \&quot;10% off\&quot;. | [optional] 
**time_period_ids** | **[String]** | Unique ID for the &#x60;CatalogTimePeriod&#x60;s when this pricing rule is in effect. If left unset, the pricing rule is always in effect. | [optional] 
**discount_id** | **String** | Unique ID for the &#x60;CatalogDiscount&#x60; to take off the price of all matched items. | [optional] 
**match_products_id** | **String** | Unique ID for the &#x60;CatalogProductSet&#x60; that will be matched by this rule. A match rule matches within the entire cart. | [optional] 
**apply_products_id** | **String** | &#x60;CatalogProductSet&#x60; to apply the pricing to. An apply rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set). An apply rule can only match once in the match set. If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set. Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. This field has been deprecated: new pricing rules should prefer the exclude_products_id field. Exclude sets allow better control over quantity ranges and offer more flexibility for which matched items receive a discount. | [optional] [deprecated]
**exclude_products_id** | **String** | Identifies the &#x60;CatalogProductSet&#x60; to exclude from this pricing rule. An exclude rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set). An exclude rule can only match once in the match set. If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set. Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | [optional] 
**valid_from_date** | **String** | Represents the date the Pricing Rule is valid from. Represented in RFC3339 full-date format (YYYY-MM-DD). | [optional] 
**valid_from_local_time** | **String** | Represents the local time the pricing rule should be valid from. Time zone is determined by the device running the Point of Sale app.  Represented in RFC3339 partial-time format (HH:MM:SS). Partial seconds will be truncated. | [optional] 
**valid_until_date** | **String** | Represents the date the pricing rule will become inactive.  Represented in RFC3339 full-date format (YYYY-MM-DD). | [optional] 
**valid_until_local_time** | **String** | Represents the local time at which the pricing rule will become inactive. Time zone is determined by the device running the Point of Sale app.  Represented in RFC3339 partial-time format (HH:MM:SS). Partial seconds will be truncated. | [optional] 
**exclude_strategy** | **String** | If an &#x60;exclude_products_id&#x60; was given, controls which subset of matched products is excluded from any discounts. See &#x60;ExcludeStrategy&#x60; for all possible values.  Default value: &#x60;LEAST_EXPENSIVE&#x60; See [ExcludeStrategy](#type-excludestrategy) for possible values | [optional]
